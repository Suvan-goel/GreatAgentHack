    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct LLM vs ReAct Agents**\n",
    "   - Direct LLM: Fast, simple, single-step\n",
    "   - ReAct Agent: Multi-step reasoning, tool use, self-correction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modern ReAct Pattern**\n",
    "   - Uses function calling (not text parsing like original 2022 paper)\n",
    "   - Structured tool execution via LLM APIs\n",
    "   - Message-based state management\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LangGraph's `create_react_agent`**\n",
    "   - Official prebuilt implementation\n",
    "   - Handles state, tools, execution loop\n",
    "   - Production-ready pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Power of Tools**\n",
    "   - Agents without tools: Limited to training data\n",
    "   - Agents with tools: Access to real-time information\n",
    "   - Valyu search: AI-optimized search engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use ReAct Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use ReAct agents when you need:**\n",
    "- Real-time information (web search, APIs)\n",
    "- Multi-step reasoning (planning, breaking down tasks)\n",
    "- Tool execution (databases, calculators, APIs)\n",
    "- Self-correction and iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Use direct LLM calls when:**\n",
    "- Simple Q&A (no external data needed)\n",
    "- Text generation, summarization\n",
    "- Speed is critical\n",
    "- Task is single-step\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue your learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **02_custom_tools.ipynb** - Build your own custom tools\n",
    "2. **03_structured_output.ipynb** - Get JSON responses with Pydantic schemas\n",
    "3. **04_model_monitoring.ipynb** - Track costs, tokens, and carbon footprint\n",
